## Description 

I developed a team profile generator. It can help any organization to use this up and updating thier employees informaion easily. It is designed to incorporate as much as the users demand. For example if the user wants to develope his 100 emplyes he/she can use it with out any modification. It will accomodate as much as they want. Once this app is developed they can generate their employees profile easily. It is time saving, easy and can be refactored if necessary. The application designed for an organization who have only for three different roles of employes. If needed it is possible to widen it as much as needed. To develop this application, I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, a software registry and software package manager and installer called Node Package Manager (npm) and node.js and some of its framworks like OOP.  

## Motivation 

Now a days the way of informaion management is highly migrated from manual to digital form.
